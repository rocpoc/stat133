This assignment explores creating functions—including conditional statements, for loops, string manipulation—and documenting them with Roxygen functions. These functions will all be tested using the R package 'testthat'. Functions include: a minkowski distance calculator, a counting vowels function, a hexidecimal string validator, and a function to reverse a character string.
